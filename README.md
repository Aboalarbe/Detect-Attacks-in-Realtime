# Detection of data exfiltration via DNS in Realtime

implementation of a binary classifier aiming at predicting data exfiltration via DNS from a data stream (local Kafka Server).

## Introduction

While originally not intended for data transfer, the Domain Name System (DNS) is currently used to this end anyway, in a process called DNS tunneling (DNST). Malicious
users exploit DNST for data exfiltration from infected machines, posing a critical security threat. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, random forest, and ensemble classifiers to detect tunneling in DNS traffic. Finally, we assess the classifiersâ€™ performance and robustness by exposing them to one day of real-traffic data.
